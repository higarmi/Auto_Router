This program creates a traveling route based on a list of destinations.
The destinations are addresses extracted from a document that can be 
uploaded by the user from a local drive (by clicking a button and 
browsing) or by dragging and dropping it on the file-drop region (above
the map.
Once the file is uploaded, the program reads the addresses and allows the 
user to select them. The user defines the start intermediate points and
final destination. The program then shows a map that covers an area
large enough to show all destination point. Finally, the program 
highlights the route.
